Pogonos is another Clojure implementation of the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) templating language.

## Features

- Completely compliant to the [Mustache spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec), including lambdas
- Fast, but clean implementation
- User-friendly error messages for parsing errors
- Supporting all of Clojure, ClojureScript and self-hosted ClojureScript

## Installation

Add the following to your project's `:dependencies`:

[![Clojars Project](https://clojars.org/pogonos/latest-version.svg)](https://clojars.org/pogonos)

## Usage

We will show you how to use Pogonos in this section, but if you're not too familiar with the Mustache language itself, you might want to read its [documentation](http://mustache.github.io/) first.

### Fundamentals

The easiest way to use the library is to just call `render-string`:

```clojure
(require '[pogonos.core :as pg])

(pg/render-string "Hello, {{name}}!" {:name "Rich"})
;=> "Hello, Rich!"
```

`render-string` takes two arguments; a string that represents a Mustache template,
and a map of the values passed to the template.
The keys of the map must be keywords.

The function, then, will render the template and return the resulting string.
If you'd rather write out the resulting content to somewhere, instead of
generating a string, you can use *outputs* to specify where to output the result.
See [Outputs](#outputs) for the details.

`render-string` has look-alike cousins named `render-file` and `render-resource`.
The only difference between `render-string` and these is that `render-string`
directly takes a template string as an argument whereas `render-file` and
`render-resource` load a template stored in a text file on the file system
or a resource file placed somewhere on the classpath.

Let's say you have a template file located at `resources/sample.mustache`
whose content looks like the following:

```sh
$ cat resources/sample.mustache
Hello, {{name}}!
```

Then, you can render the template using `render-file`:

```clojure
;; load a template from a text file on the file system
(pg/render-file "resources/sample.mustache" {:name "Rich"})
```

Or if you have the template file on your classpath, you can also render it
with `render-resource` (Here we assume the `resources` directory is
included in the classpath):

```clojure
;; load a template from a resource file on the classpath
(pg/render-resource "sample.mustache" {:name "Rich"})
```

All the render functions mentioned above are more suitable for one-shot
rendering. If you want to render the same template with different contexts
over and over again, it would be more efficient to prepare a parsed template
prior to rendering.

To prepare a parsed template, use `parse-string` (or `parse-file` / `parse-resource`
accordingly):

```clojure
(def template (pg/parse-string "Hello, {{name}}!"))
template
;=> #pogonos.nodes.Root{:body ["Hello, " #pogonos.nodes.Variable{:keys (:name), :unescaped? false} "!"]}
```

And then, you can render the parsed template using the `render` function:

```clojure
(pg/render template {:name "Rich"})
;=> "Hello, Rich!"

(pg/render template {:name "Alex"})
;=> "Hello, Alex!"
```

At the time, Pogonos does not have an internal mechanism to implicitly cache
parsing results for templates you've ever rendered for better performance
of rendering. So, if you use Pogonos in a situation where the rendering performance
matters much, you may have to cache parsed templates on your own.

### Outputs

An output is the way to specify where to output the rendering result.
By default, Pogonos' render functions output the result as a string.
You can emulate this behavior by specifying `(pogonos.output/to-string)`
to them as the output like the following:

```clojure
(require '[pogonos.output :as output])

(pg/render-string "Hello, {{name}}!" {:name "Clojure"}
                  {:output (output/to-string)})
;=> "Hello, Clojure!"
```

You can also write out the rendering result to a file or the stdout via output:

```clojure
;; Writes the rendering result to a file
(pg/render-string "Hello, {{name}}!" {:name "Clojure"}
                  {:output (output/to-file "hello.txt")})

;; Writes the rendering result to the stdout
(pg/render-string "Hello, {{name}}!" {:name "Clojure"}
                  {:output (output/to-stdout)})
```

In general, it's more efficient to write out the rendering result
directly to a file than to generate a resulting string, and then write it
out to the file.

### Partials

```clojure
(pg/render-string "{{>node}}" {:content "X" :nodes [{:content "Y" :nodes []}]}
                  {:partials {:node "{{content}}<{{#nodes}}{{>node}}{{/nodes}}>"}})
;=> "X<Y<>>"
```
